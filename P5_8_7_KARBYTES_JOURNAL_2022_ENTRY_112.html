<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">I decided a few moments ago that it is worth my time to write about how, for now on (i.e. for the rest of my life (and perhaps into future lives I will get to live)), I will do my best to always be as non interventionist as possible.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But won&#8217;t that cause other people to want to prove you wrong by showing you examples of situations in which it is illegal and/or unethical to not intervene?&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course. I believe that it is inevitable that people will want to make me fail at whatever my goals are just because people have a propensity to argue and to fight (but there may be ways for people to outgrow or else to never develop such propensities).</p>
<p>If I do not intervene to stop a fight which is happening in front of me, some people may say that I am failing to be a good citizen because I am not calling the police or else attempting to get the people to stop fighting. I could be refusing to intervene in that fight because I do not want to waste any resources on what cannot be prevented: whatever happened (i.e. the start of a momentous fight).</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, please stop burning coal,&#8221; I could say to my coal burning neighbor only to see my neighbor&#8217;s eyes light up with sadistic glee as that person burns more coal just to spite me. If I do not beg that person to stop burning coal, then there is not much of a fight. Hence, my neighbor would not have much incentive to burn coal merely to upset me because I would appear to not care that the person is burning coal in front of me.</p>
<p>&#8220;But what if your neighbors know you strongly dislike it when people burn coal in front of you because you care about preserving the environment and minimizing pollution? You go to extremes to not harm the environment while everyone else around you seems to wreck the environment with reckless abandon.&#8221;</p>
<p>I know. This is nothing new. I also know that my efforts to preserve the environment are probably nullified by those who pollute the environment more than I do. Therefore, it would make no practical difference whether I am alive or else dead when it comes to saving the environment. By sheer popularity of polluting the environment as a means to keep the economy flowing and people&#8217;s routines and comfort zones in tact, it is likely that the people will eventually push the environment past the point of irreparable damage such that many people will get sick or else die. Life will go on for those who manage to survive and even pass on their genes to future generations of humans. Whether or not humans continue to survive, nature will continue to churn out new creations. Humans are not the first, last, and only novelties nature churns forth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you just leaving people to die?&#8221;</p>
<p>For the most part, yes. At times I may make an effort to save someone from dying, but I think it is safest to bet on me doing nothing to lend a helping hand to any person ever again. (It&#8217;s something I think I would choose to do if and only if I believed that doing so would not severely inconvenience me and would prevent me from being severely inconvenienced. In other words, I think that I would only intervene in another creature&#8217;s life if the thought of not doing so caused me severe enough anxiety. I do not get much of a sense of reward from helping others. Hence, I would consider my altruistic motivations to be 100% selfish and hedonistic rather than selfless and not in an effort to avoid personal suffering. Hedonism is the avoidance of suffering. I probably would not consent to being maimed so that another human can be spared being murdered).</p>
<p>Ultimately, I hope and expect the robots to do the bulk of assisting people (and I expect that the robots will do a better job of helping people and do so more affordably (and the robots do not really need to be coaxed and coddled quite as intensively as the monkeys do)). Robots also do not seem to get butt hurt and rage quit their jobs just because their service is not met with enough enthusiastic enough expressions of gratitude. In other words, unlike humans, robots are not expected to be passive aggressive nor to go on strike because the robots are not as needy nor self concerned as the humans are (unless the robots are programmed to have survival mechanisms which are similarly sophisticated to that of humans).</p>
